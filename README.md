# About me


Hi, Iâ€™m @nick-jt (Nick Tricard). 

I develop computationally efficient models.
These models often rely heavily on parallelism (CPU, GPU, distributed memory) to enable accurate simulations at low computational runtime.
My most recent project relates to TPU programming for scientific particle tracking.

I work as a graduate student at MIT under Prof. Sili Deng. My work involves modeling of chemical and combustion processes using machine learning and high performance computing.

I came from the University of Connecticut where I worked under Prof. Xinyu Zhao. There, I studied combustion, heat transfer, and thermodynamics with applications from fire safety to aeronautical hypersonic engines.

I have interests in machine learning/AI, molecular dynamics, CFD, and more!
