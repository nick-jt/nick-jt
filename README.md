# About me


Hi, Iâ€™m @nick-jt (Nick Tricard). 

I develop computationally efficient models for combustion and heat transfer systems.
These models often rely heavily on parallelism (CPU, GPU, distributed-memory) to ensure accurate simulations at low computational cost.
My most recent project relates to learning optimal GPU programming for scientific ray-tracing.

I work as a graduate student at the University of Connecticut under Prof. Xinyu Zhao.
Our lab researches combustion, heat transfer, and thermodynamics with applications from fire safety to aeronautical engines.
